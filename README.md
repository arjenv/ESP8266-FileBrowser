# ESP8266-FileBrowser

Searching for a solution to list files/dowmload/upload/rename and more, I came up empty.
Found bits & pieces, so here is my template. Just add it to your directory. Make a link to /files in your index.html.
examine the index.html in the list.

Plug in .ino for ESP8266
File adminnstration of LittleFS files in your project

It can:
  - List files
  - rename files
  - upload files
  - download files
  - delete files
  - make a new directory
  - download directories as TAR

  See the index.html for the libraries used
  do not forget to add a #define for your convenience, e.g.
  #define Version "FileBrowser V1.0 July 17, 2024" (as in the example index.html)

I am but an amateur programmer. Improvements? let me know.
